<br>

## These are some of my academic coding projects.
<br>

### NOTE: All projects are written in Java
<br>

1. ***Day_Finder_2001_2100:*** This project basically finds the day of the week when we input a particular date in traditional format.
<br>

2. ***Genetics_Predictor_Colour_Blindness:*** This project predicts whether the probable offspring of parents have colourblindness or not. It involves taking input of the colourblindness gene of both the parents.   
<br>

3. ***Toll-And-Roll_Probabilities:*** This project lists all the possible outcomes for multiple coin tossing and dice rolling. 
<br>

4. ***Project_Mind_Reader:*** This is simple project which guess your chosen number between 1-100 by asking a series of intuitive questions.
